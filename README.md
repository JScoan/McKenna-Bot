# McKenna-Bot
plans to make a Terence McKenna-Bot

This twitter bot should do the following: 

1. go to terence mckenna transcription project
2. select a random essay
3. select a random sentence
4. use a neural network to assess the sentence,
4a. neural network should accept the string input, and will output a boolean
4b. train neural network by seeing if I would choose the sentance as acceptably interesting or not, network to predict me.
if true, post to twitter, sleep for an hour
if false, goto 10
